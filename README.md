# LTSM-Stock-Model
An LTSM Stock predictor built with python and uses the Alpaca Stock Trader API to trade.


The bot is has a list of stocks
<br></br>
  The bot iterates through each Stock and runs an LTSM model on the stock based on previous prices
 <br></br>
 The bot then looks at the previous days close price and takes the predicted price and determines whether to make the trade or not
 <br></br>
 **Coming Soon**
<br></br>
Will add a node.js file that will use firebase cloud to execute the python file every day
